## Create your hero.

Roll 3d6 each for **Body** (*physical prowess & health*), **Mind** (*mental capacity & intelligence*), **Soul** (*spirit & willpower*). Each starts at 1 and each even number rolled is a +1. To generate Hit Points, roll 3d6, count the evens and add this to Body score (monsters use Body equals Hit Points). Characters begin with one cliché, roll 3d6, and gain one cliché for each even number rolled. If you wish, flesh out a background, looks, quirks, etc. Be creative and stuff.

## Determine goals & the first scene.

Figure out why your character is there and where in the story they are. *Are you plundering a tomb? Rescuing the princess?* This is a short description of where our hero is and what's happening. Imagine a starting point for your adventure.

## Begin asking questions.

To begin play, ask a question that has a **yes** or **no** answer, it is important to keep it simple. *Do I encounter a trap? Are guards present?*

For each question, roll a d6 and consult the table below. If the hero has an applicable cliché or an advantage, roll 2d6 and choose the best result. If the character has a significant disadvantage, roll 2d6 and use the worst result.

1- *No, And*  
2- *No*  
3- *No, But*  
4- *Yes, But*  
5- *Yes*  
6- *Yes, And*

## And & But Results.

*And* amplifies, while *But* mitigates. *No, And* means things went really bad. *No, But* softens the blow a bit. *Yes, But* is successful but with a drawback. *Yes, And* is all kinds of awesome.

1- Nothing significant happens  
2- An obstacle, something to overcome  
3- A unique feature or situation  
4- A unique feature or situation  
5- NPC (1-3 friendly, 4-5 neutral, 6 not friendly)  
6- Monster (1 friendly, 2-3 neutral, 4-6 not friendly)

*You can use the above method to determine the outcome of encounters, or use the optional rules that follow to expand the depth of the system.*

## Contests.

When your character comes into dangerous or risky situations, Determine Difficulty (either via narratory license or dice, *see below*). Use dice equal to Body, Mind, or Soul for the contest, adding one die to the roll if a cliché is applicable. If *ONE* die rolls equal to the Difficulty or higher, you succeed!

## Determine Difficulty.

To randomly determine difficulty of a task, roll a d6:

1- Automatic  
2- Simple  
3- Easy  
4- Average  
5- Tricky  
6- Hard

## Resolving Combat.

Resolve combat as if two characters were facing off using the stats listed for monsters, where the high roll wins the round/combat. Ties are a deadlock or draw with no damage. All attacks cause one damage.

## Taking/Causing/Healing Damage.

If you succeed at a combat check, subtract one HP from the enemy, if you fail, subtract one of your HPs. You may reduce the Body score instead of HP and any subsequent Body contests use the current score. When Body or HP reach zero, you are dead. Heal HP at a rate one per eight hours of rest, one Body at a rate of one per day.

## Example clichés.

*The veteran warrior, Nimble-fingered rogue, Sneaky little bastard, Spellbinder of the elemental flames, Priest of Assaradin, Sticky fingers*

## Sample Characters:

**Alessandor the Blade** B:2 M:1 S:1 HP:2 *Cleric of Pastorin, Master of the Duel*  
**Byran Spellslinger** B:1 M:3 S:2 HP:1 *Mage of the Forgotten Water Splendids*

## Sample Monsters:

**Goblin** B:1 M:1 S:1 HP:1 *Sneaky little bastard*  
**Owlbear** B:3 M:1 S:1 HP:3 *Grapple, Berserk*  
**Squidhead** B:2 M:3 S:3 HP:2 *Mind control, Illusion magic, Madness*  
**Zombie** B:1 M:1 S:1 HP:1 *Silent, Infection*
