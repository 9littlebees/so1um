# so1um 1.0

## Create your hero.

Complex systems typically get bogged down in numerics so we will use the **So1um system:** Roll 3d6 each for Body, Smarts, Will. Each starts at 1 and each even number rolled is a +1. Hit Points equal the Body score. Next, roll 3d6, each even number rolled is a slot for a cliché. Be creative and shit.

## Determine goals & set up first Scene.

Figure out why your character is there and where in the story they are. *Are they plundering a tomb? Rescuing the princess?* This is a short description of where our hero is and what's happening. Imagine a starting point for the adventure.

## Begin asking questions.

Ask a question that has a yes or no answer, it is important to keep it simple and able to be answered in this means. *Do I encounter a trap? Are guards present?*

For each question, roll a d6 and read the result below. If the hero has an applicable cliché or advantage, roll a second d6 and choose the result. If a significant disadvantage is present, roll 2d6 and use the lowest result.

1- No and  
2- No  
3- No But  
4- Yes But  
5- Yes  
6- Yes And

## “And” & “but” Results.

"And" means more than you expected - a good thing, "But" means there is a limited effect or a drawback. “And” can also mean a good interpretation on the roll below, “But” can be a negative interpretation on the roll below.

1- Nothing significant  
2- Trap or some obstacle  
3- Unique feature, helpful  
4- Unique feature, hurtful  
5- NPC (1-3 friendly, 4-5 neutral, 6 not friendly)  
6- Monster (1 friendly, 2-3 neutral, 4-6 not friendly)

*You can use the above method to determine the outcome of encounters, or use the optional rule below to expand the depth of the system.*

## Contests. (opt. rule)

When your character comes into dangerous or risky situations Determine Difficulty (either via narratory license or dice, *see below*). Use dice equal to Body, Smarts, or Will for the check. If a cliché is applicable, add one die to the roll. If ONE die rolls the Difficulty or higher, you succeed!

## Determine Difficulty.

Randomly determine difficulty of a task, roll a d6:

1- Simple  
2- Easy  
3- Easy  
4- Tricky  
5- Tricky  
6- Hard

## Taking/Causing Damage.

If you succeed in a contest, subtract one HP from the enemy, if you fail, subtract one of your HPs. When you reach zero, you are dead.

## Example clichés.

*The Bravest Warrior, Knowledgeable Monk, No-it-all-asshole rogue, Sneaky little fucker, I can feel the magic, Apothecary to the King, Spellbinder of the elemental flames, Cleric of the White Light of Assaradin, Sticky fingers*

## Sample Characters:

**Alessandor the Blade** B: 2 S:1 W: 1 HP: 2 *Cleric of Pastorin, Healer of the Wounded*  
**Byran Spellslinger** B: 1 S: 3 W: 2 HP: 1 *Mage of the Forgotten Water Splendids*
