## Create your hero.

Roll 3d6 once each for **Body** (*physical prowess & health*), **Mind** (*mental capacity & intelligence*), **Soul** (*spirit & willpower*). Count dice with even #s for each stat. If no evens are rolled, the stat equals 1. For Hit Points roll 2d6, count the evens and add this to Body score. Heroes begin with one cliché, roll 2d6, and gain one cliché for each even number rolled. If you wish, determine a past, looks, quirks, etc. Be creative and stuff.

## Determine goals & the first scene.

Figure out why your character is there and where in the story they are. This is a short description of where our hero is and what's happening. Imagine a starting point for your adventure. Are you *stealing space station plans? Are you plundering a tomb?*

## Begin asking questions.

To begin play, ask a question that has a **Yes** or **No** answer, it is important to keep it simple. *Are guards present? Do I encounter a trap?* For each question, roll a d6 and consult the table below. If the hero has an applicable cliché or an advantage, roll 2d6 and pick the best result. If the character has a significant disadvantage, roll 2d6 and use the worst result.

1- *No, And*  
2- *No*  
3- *No, But*  
4- *Yes, But*  
5- *Yes*  
6- *Yes, And*

## And & But Results.

*And* amplifies, while *But* mitigates. *No, And* means things went really bad. *No, But* softens the blow a bit. *Yes, But* is successful but with a drawback. *Yes, And* is all kinds of awesome.

1- Nothing significant happens  
2- An obstacle or something that aids the hero  
3- A unique feature or situation  
4- A unique feature or situation  
5- NPC (1-3 friendly, 4-5 neutral, 6 not friendly)  
6- Monster (1 friendly, 2-3 neutral, 4-6 not friendly)

## Contests.

When your character comes into dangerous or risky situations, determine Difficulty (either via narratory license or dice, *see below*). Use dice equal to Body, Mind, or Soul for the contest, adding one die to the roll if a cliché is applicable. If ONE die rolls equal to the Difficulty or higher, you succeed!

## Determine Difficulty.

To randomly determine difficulty of a task, roll a d6:

1- *Automatic*  
2- *Simple*  
3- *Easy*  
4- *Average*  
5- *Tricky*  
6- *Hard*

## Resolving Combat.

Resolve combat as if two characters were facing off using the stats listed for monsters, where the high roll wins the round/combat. If the rolls are a tie, the defender has managed to protect themselves and no damage is caused by the attack. Successful *attacks* cause one damage.

## Taking/Causing/Healing Damage.

If you succeed at a combat check, subtract one HP from the enemy, if you fail, subtract one of your HPs. You may reduce the Body score instead of HP and any subsequent Body contests use the current score. When Body or HP reach zero, you are dead. Heal HP at a rate one per eight hours of rest, one Body at a rate of one per day.

## Gear and Loot

Useful gear allows you to reroll one die once when performing a task for which the piece of gear was intended. Dice are then compared again to determine the outcome of the contest. Characters can only benefit from one piece of gear, weapon, or armor per check and are only allowed to reroll one die once per check. Note that in combat it is assumed all are properly armed/armored and this rule would not be applicable.

## Example clichés.

*The veteran warrior, Nimble-fingered rogue, Sneaky little bastard, Spellbinder of the elemental flames, Priest of Asaradin, Sticky fingers, Smuggler with a heart of gold*

## Sample Characters:

**Alessandor the Blade** B:2 M:1 S:1 HP:2 *Cleric of Pastorin, Master of the Duel*  
**Byran Spellslinger** B:1 M:3 S:2 HP:1 *Mage of the Forgotten Water Splendids*

## Sample Monsters:

**Goblin** B:1 M:1 S:2 HP:1 *Sneaky little bastard*  
**Owlbear** B:4 M:1 S:3 HP:5 *Grapple, Berserk*  
**Squidhead** B:2 M:4 S:3 HP:6 *Mind control, Illusion magic, Madness*
